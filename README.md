Dice App
This Flutter project is a simple dice rolling application. It demonstrates basic concepts in Flutter such as state management, layout building, and handling user interactions.

Features:
Dice Rolling: The app allows users to roll two dice by tapping on them. Each tap randomly changes the number displayed on the dice.
Background Image: The app includes a custom background image (images/bg.jpg) set using a Container with BoxDecoration.
Responsive Layout: The UI is designed using Flutter's flexible Row and Expanded widgets, ensuring that the dice images adjust to different screen sizes.
Project Structure:
main.dart: Contains the complete application code, including the DiceApp widget, which handles the main functionality, and the MyApp widget, which serves as the entry point.
Getting Started:
Ensure that the background image (images/bg.jpg) is available in the images directory.
Add the image path to the pubspec.yaml file under the assets section.
Run the app using flutter run.
This project is a great starting point for beginners learning Flutter, as it covers fundamental concepts while being easy to understand and extend.
